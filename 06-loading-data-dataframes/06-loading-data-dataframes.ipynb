    "## Exploring Data Frames\n",
    "\n",
    "You might have noticed that data frames are rendered in nice HTML tables within Jupyter Notebooks. For small data frames, just showing all the data makes sense, but for larger datasets, like our `hit_albums` dataset, plotting 70+ rows can be annoying, and for datasets with hundreds or thousands of rows it can be prohibitive. By default, a data frame only prints a limited number of elements (notice the `...` in row 30 of the output of `hit_albums` above - only the first 30 and last 30 are printed. \n",
    "\n",
    "When working with data, e.g., when transforming or loading a dataset, it is important to see the raw data, for example, to check if a transformation was done correctly. Often, however, it's sufficient to see a part of the data, e.g., the first couple of rows and/or the last couple of rows. We can do this with the `head()` and `tail()` function:\n"
