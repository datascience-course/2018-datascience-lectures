    "# MATH 4100: Temporal data analysis and applications to stock analysis\n",
    "*Curtis Miller*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a lecture for [MATH 4100/CS 5160: Introduction to Data Science](http://datasciencecourse.net/), offered at the University of Utah, introducing time series data analysis applied to finance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advanced mathematics and statistics have been present in finance for some time. Prior to the 1980s, banking and finance were well-known for being \"boring\"; investment banking was distinct from commercial banking and the primary role of the industry was handling \"simple\" (at least in comparison to today) financial instruments, such as loans. Deregulation under the Regan administration, coupled with an influx of mathematical talent, transformed the industry from the \"boring\" business of banking to what it is today, and since then, finance has joined the other sciences as a motivation for mathematical research and advancement. For example one of the biggest recent achievements of mathematics was the derivation of the [Black-Scholes formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%E2%80%93Scholes_model), which facilitated the pricing of stock options (a contract giving the holder the right to purchase or sell a stock at a particular price to the issuer of the option). That said, [bad statistical models, including the Black-Scholes formula, hold part of the blame for the 2008 financial crisis](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/feb/12/black-scholes-equation-credit-crunch).\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years, computer science has joined advanced mathematics in revolutionizing finance and **trading**, the practice of buying and selling of financial assets for the purpose of making a profit. In recent years, trading has become dominated by computers; algorithms are responsible for making rapid split-second trading decisions faster than humans could make (so rapidly, [the speed at which light travels is a limitation when designing systems](http://www.nature.com/news/physics-in-finance-trading-at-the-speed-of-light-1.16872)). Additionally, [machine learning and data mining techniques are growing in popularity](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/9278d1b6-1e02-11e6-b286-cddde55ca122.html#axzz4G8daZxcl) in the financial sector, and likely will continue to do so. For example, **high-frequency trading (HFT)** is a branch of algorithmic trading where computers make thousands of trades in short periods of time, engaging in complex strategies such as statistical arbitrage and market making. While algorithms may outperform humans, the technology is still new and playing an increasing role in a famously turbulent, high-stakes arena. HFT was responsible for phenomena such as the [2010 flash crash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Flash_Crash) and a [2013 flash crash](http://money.cnn.com/2013/04/24/investing/twitter-flash-crash/) prompted by a hacked [Associated Press tweet](http://money.cnn.com/2013/04/23/technology/security/ap-twitter-hacked/index.html?iid=EL) about an attack on the White House.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lecture, however, will not be about how to crash the stock market with bad mathematical models or trading algorithms. Instead, I intend to provide you with basic tools for handling and analyzing stock market data with Python. We will be using stock data as a first exposure to **time series data**, which is data considered dependent on the time it was observed (other examples of time series include temperature data, demand for energy on a power grid, Internet server load, and many, many others). I will also discuss moving averages, how to construct trading strategies using moving averages, how to formulate exit strategies upon entering a position, and how to evaluate a strategy with backtesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**DISCLAIMER: THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE!!! Furthermore, I have ZERO experience as a trader (a lot of this knowledge comes from a one-semester course on stock trading I took at Salt Lake Community College)! This is purely introductory knowledge, not enough to make a living trading stocks. People can and do lose money trading stocks, and you do so at your own risk!**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preliminaries\n",
    "\n",
    "I will be using two packages, **quandl** and **pandas_datareader**, which are not installed with [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) if you are using it. To install these packages, run the following at the appropriate command prompt:\n",

    "\n",
    "### Getting Data from Quandl\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we analyze stock data, we need to get it into some workable format. Stock data can be obtained from [Yahoo! Finance](http://finance.yahoo.com), [Google Finance](http://finance.google.com), or a number of other sources. These days I recommend getting data from [Quandl](https://www.quandl.com/), a provider of community-maintained financial and economic data. (Yahoo! Finance used to be the go-to source for good quality stock data, but the API was discontinued in 2017 and reliable data can no longer be obtained: see [this question/answer on StackExchange](https://quant.stackexchange.com/questions/35019/is-yahoo-finance-data-good-or-bad-now) for more details.)\n",

While stock prices are considered to be set mostly by traders, **stock splits** (when the company makes each extant stock worth two and halves the price) and **dividends** (payout of company profits per share) also affect the price of a stock and should be accounted for.\n",

The advantage of using log differences is that this difference can be interpreted as the percentage change in a stock but does not depend on the denominator of a fraction. Additionally, log differences have a desirable property: the sum of the log differences can be interpreted as the total change (as a percentage) over the period summed (which is not a property of the other formulations; they will overestimate growth).

Additionally, in any trade, a trader must have an **exit strategy**, a set of conditions determining when she will exit the position, for either profit or loss. A trader may set a **target**, which is the minimum profit that will induce the trader to leave the position. Likewise, a trader may have a maximum loss she is willing to tolerate; if potential losses go beyond this amount, the trader will exit the position in order to prevent any further loss. We will suppose that the amount of money in the portfolio involved in any particular trade is a fixed proportion; 10% seems like a good number.\n",

    "Here, I will be demonstrating a [moving average crossover strategy](http://www.investopedia.com/university/movingaverage/movingaverages4.asp). We will use two moving averages, one we consider \"fast\", and the other \"slow\". The strategy is:\n",

    "* Trade the asset when the fast moving average crosses over the slow moving average.\n",
    "* Exit the trade when the fast moving average crosses over the slow moving average again.\n",

The usual means for doing so is **backtesting**, which is looking at how profitable the strategy is on historical data. For example, looking at the above chart's performance on Apple stock, if the 20-day moving average is the fast moving average and the 50-day moving average the slow, this strategy does not appear to be very profitable, at least not if you are always taking long positions.\n",

    "You may notice that the system as it currently stands isn't very robust, since even a fleeting moment when the fast moving average is above the slow moving average triggers a trade, resulting in trades that end immediately (which is bad if not simply because realistically every trade is accompanied by a fee that can quickly erode earnings). Additionally, every bullish regime immediately transitions into a bearish regime, and if you were constructing trading systems that allow both bullish and bearish bets, this would lead to the end of one trade immediately triggering a new trade that bets on the market in the opposite direction, which again seems finnicky. A better system would require more evidence that the market is moving in some particular direction. But we will not concern ourselves with these details for now.\n",

    "What could we do to improve the performance of our system? For starters, we could try diversifying. All the stocks we considered were tech companies, which means that if the tech industry is doing poorly, our portfolio will reflect that. We could try developing a system that can also short stocks or bet bearishly, so we can take advantage of movement in any direction. We could seek means for forecasting how high we expect a stock to move. Whatever we do, though, must beat this benchmark; otherwise there is an opportunity cost associated with our trading system.\n",

The general lesson still holds: *don't use a complex trading system with lots of active trading when a simple strategy involving an index fund without frequent trading beats it.* [This is actually a very difficult requirement to meet.](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/15/your-money/how-many-mutual-funds-routinely-rout-the-market-zero.html?_r=0)\n",
    "\n",
    "As a final note, suppose that your trading system *did* manage to beat any baseline strategy thrown at it in backtesting. Does backtesting predict future performance? Not at all. [Backtesting has a propensity for overfitting](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2745220), so just because backtesting predicts high growth doesn't mean that growth will hold in the future. There are strategies for combatting overfitting, such as [walk-forward analysis](https://ntguardian.wordpress.com/2017/06/19/walk-forward-analysis-demonstration-backtrader/) and holding out a portion of a dataset (likely the most recent part) as a final test set to determine if a strategy is profitable, followed by \"sitting on\" a strategy that managed to survive these two filters and seeing if it remains profitable in current markets.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "While this lecture ends on a depressing note, keep in mind that [the efficient market hypothesis has many critics.](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/06/business/06nocera.html) My own opinion is that as trading becomes more algorithmic, beating the market will become more difficult. That said, it may be possible to beat the market, even though mutual funds seem incapable of doing so (bear in mind, though, that part of the reason mutual funds perform so poorly is because of fees, which is not a concern for index funds).\n",
    "\n",
    "This lecture is very brief, covering only one type of strategy: strategies based on moving averages. Many other trading signals exist and employed. Additionally, we never discussed in depth shorting stocks, currency trading, or stock options. Stock options, in particular, are a rich subject that offer many different ways to bet on the direction of a stock. You can read more about derivatives (including stock options and other derivatives) in the book *Derivatives Analytics with Python: Data Analysis, Models, Simulation, Calibration and Hedging*, [which is available from the University of Utah library.](http://proquest.safaribooksonline.com.ezproxy.lib.utah.edu/9781119037996)\n",
    "\n",
    "Another resource (which I used as a reference while writing this lecture) is the O'Reilly book *Python for Finance*, [also available from the University of Utah library.](http://proquest.safaribooksonline.com.ezproxy.lib.utah.edu/book/programming/python/9781491945360)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you were interested in investigating algorithmic trading, where would you go from here? I would not recommend using the code I wrote above for backtesting; there are better packages for this task. Python has some libraries for algorithmic trading, such as [**pyfolio**](https://quantopian.github.io/pyfolio/) (for analytics), [**zipline**](http://www.zipline.io/beginner-tutorial.html) (for backtesting and algorithmic trading), and [**backtrader**](https://www.backtrader.com/) (also for backtesting and trading). **zipline** seems to be popular likely because it is used and developed by [**quantopian**](https://www.quantopian.com/), a \"crowd-sourced hedge fund\" that allows users to use their data for backtesting and even will license profitable strategies from their authors, giving them a cut of the profits. However, I prefer **backtrader** and have written [blog posts](https://ntguardian.wordpress.com/tag/backtrader/) on using it. It is likely the more complicated between the two but that's the cost of greater power. I am a fan of its design. I also would suggest learning [R](https://www.r-project.org/), since it has many packages for analyzing financial data (moreso than Python) and it's surprisingly easy to use R functions in Python (as I demonstrate in [this post](https://ntguardian.wordpress.com/2017/06/28/stock-trading-analytics-and-optimization-in-python-with-pyfolio-rs-performanceanalytics-and-backtrader/)).\n",

    "You can read more about using R and Python for finance on [my blog](https://ntguardian.wordpress.com).\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that it is possible (if not common) to lose money in the stock market. It's also true, though, that it's difficult to find returns like those found in stocks, and any investment strategy should take investing in it seriously. This lecture is intended to provide a starting point for evaluating stock trading and investments, and, more generally, analyzing temporal data, and I hope you continue to explore these ideas."
