    "Notebooks have two modes, a **command mode** and **edit mode**. You can see which mode you're in by the color of the cell: green means edit mode, blue means command mode. Many operations depend on your mode. You can switch into edit mode with \"Enter\", and get out of it with \"Escape\". \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Shortucts\n",
    "\n",
    "While you can always use the tool-bar above, you'll be much more efficient if you use a couple of shortcuts. The most important ones are:\n",
    "\n",
    "**`Ctrl+Enter`** runs the current cell.  \n",
    "**`Shift+Enter`** runs the current cell and jumps to the next cell.   \n",
    "**`Alt+Enter`** runs the cell and adds a new one below it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In command mode:\n",
    "**`h`** shows a help menu with all these commands.  \n",
    "**`a`** adds a cell before the current cell.  \n",
    "**`b`** adds a cell after the current cell.  \n",
    "**`dd`** deletes a cell.  \n",
    "**`m`** switches a cell to markdown mode.  \n",
    "**`y`** switches a cell to code.  \n",

    "#### Kernels\n",
    "\n",
    "When you [run code](http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Notebook/Running%20Code.html), the code is actually executed in a kernel. You can do bad thinks to a kernel: you can make it stuck in an endless loop, crash it, corrupt it, etc. And you probably will do all of these things :). So sometimes you might have to interrupt your kernel or restart it. Use the \"Kernel\" menu to restart the kernel, re-run your notebook, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Storing Output\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebooks contain both, the input to a computation and the outputs. If you run a notebook, all the outputs generated by the code cells are also stored in the notebook. That way, you can look at notebooks also in non-interactive environments, like on [GitHub for this notebook](https://github.com/datascience-course/2016-lab-1). Make sure to submit fully executed notebooks when you submit homeworks and assignments, but also make sure that all cells actually work!"
